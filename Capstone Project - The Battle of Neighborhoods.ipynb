    "# Introduction - The Coffee Shop Problem (Toronto)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common establishments that can be found within any neighborhood of the city of Toronto is coffee shops. Although this shows there is a great market for this type of establishment, it also shows that competition would be fierce for a new business.\n",

    "The problem is as follows, you are approached by an entrepeneur interested in starting their first small coffee shop. They are asking you to leverage available data to consult them on the most reasonable location within the city of Toronto to start their business. Key factors to take into account are population, and the presence of competition. Assuming cost of operation due to the location is not a concern, where should the entrepeneur open their coffee shop?\n",
    "\n",
    "The intended audience for this report are entrepeneurs potentials hoping to make the same decision as the hypthetical one mentioned above, using the analysis provided to help their decision. Secondary to this, other data scientists and the curious may also find this report useful as an insight into the business demographics of neighborhoods within their city.\n",

    "# Data - Wikipedia and Foursquare API\n",

    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n",
    "\n",
    "The foursquare API will also be used in order to makes sense of the postal codes provided by wikipedia by accessing nearby venues within each neighborhood in order to identify competition in the area.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above data and API will be used to gether to create a map visualizing viable neighborhoods in toronto and their potential value as a location for a new coffee shop."
